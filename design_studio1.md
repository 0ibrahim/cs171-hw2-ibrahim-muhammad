Part 1

1. These visualization are showing how the active the repositories are over time in terms of how they were commited to, merged and forked. The data represented is braches which are shown using different color, the users identified in the SVG element on the y-axis. Forks are shown in different user repositories at their own master files, which contain their own unique branches, some of which merge to the orignal file, while many remain individuals. Merging is shown as arrows which have a control point attribute aligning them to a commit point where they are merged with the master or merged with another branch. Large number of commits which were made in a short number of time need to be shown with more accuracy becasue it is difficult to distinguish them. A visualization could show the size variation between branches and forks as well as additional metadata within the label elements which appear upon hover over the nodes giving data on the number of deletions and additions that have been made. 

2. The visulaization is mainly intended for anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of the development of the project over time. There are some people who want to follow the develpment of open source projects and this visualization could be very useful to them.  Project users can determine the points at which a merge was made and at which points major problems had arisen and project visitors can see the level of activity in different repositories. 

3. A user might want to see who has contributed more to the project so that credit can be given where it is due. A user may be able to take the data and determine high levels of activity at certain time points based on the number of commits that were made. Additionally, a user of the visualization would be able to determine hierarchies in a more visually informative way where rather than having all of the nodes so far separated from one another you would be able to scale the layout via an index or a time method. 

4. The visualization should do a better job of displaying how the heirarchies of the different branches come into play.

Part 2 Questions

1. Color can be used to differentiate between branches. Size can be used to demonstrate the number of commits and the distance orlength can be used to demonstrate time.

2. It is not necessary to use a single node to represent each commit. We can aggregate multiple commits and represent them as one big cicle and distinguish between groups based on their position.

3. It is not necessary for each user to have a seperate row. This information can be summarized via a hover function that displays the contributions made by different users in either different repositories or different accounts based on varying colorations or opacities. 

4. We could also use a sunburst representation to demonstrate the heirarchal relations with variations in size of the child elements.
